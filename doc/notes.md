## Selected:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/cardano-crypto.js  
alternative: redo from  
https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js  
(used by nyzo wallet tools)

older and probably slow: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ed25519

##Â After base tests

Use tweetnacl and redo derivation, since cardano uses 64 bytes private key instead of 32
