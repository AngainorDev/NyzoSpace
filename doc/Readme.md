# NyzoSpace

Hierarchical Deterministic wallet for Nyzo Crypto currency.

JS Port.

## Overview

First attempt:  
Since Cardano also uses ED25519 crypto and designed a proper derivation scheme, we choose to use the same implementation.
Cardano provides libs in various languages, making compatible tools in various languages easier to develop.

Failure since the private key len is not the same.

## Changelog

- v0.3: Derivation
- v0.2: Move to tweetnacl
- V0.1: Init tests
